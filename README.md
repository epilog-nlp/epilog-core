# Introduction
Core functionality of an application that ingests dictionaries in various formats to a database.

# Purpose
The general purpose of this application is to ingest data from dictionaries into a database.
However, the central entities of this application are the examples for each sense, not the senses and definitions themselves.

The examples give usage information for each sense, which can be supplemented with additional information sourced from the headword, the sense, or the definition.
